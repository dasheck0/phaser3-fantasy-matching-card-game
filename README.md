# Fantasy Matching Card Game
<!-- section: Introduction -->
<!-- Describe briefly what your software is. What problem does it solve? At what target audience is it aimed? -->

This is a matching card game with a fantasy theme. The objective is to find matching pair of cards. You can turn a card by clicking on it. When clicking a second card and the cards match you get a point and the pair is removed from the game. If they don't match the cards are both turned back and it's your opponents turn. Your opponent is controlled by an AI. Good luck!
